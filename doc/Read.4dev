## Where to find or put stuff

As a CLI Application you have:
    
    1. Documentation:
        which belongs in doc

    2. Source-Code:
        which belongs in src

    3. Tests:
        which belongs in test

    4. Anything else:
        belongs in meta, because it probably serves developer convenience and
        doesn't affect the user (aka non-developer).

        Test-Question: If <something> in meta is lost, does the code still run? 


## Build-System

We use `hatchling` as it seems to be preferred by the *Python Packaging Authority*.

You can build a package either with a Makefile rule

    `make build`

or manually by invoking:

    `python -m build`.


### Build-Config

We use `pyproject.toml` as our central build and config-file.
