## Where to find or put stuff

As a CLI Application you have:
    
    1. Documentation:
        which belongs in doc

    2. Source-Code:
        which belongs in src

    3. Tests:
        which belongs in test

    4. Anything else:
        belongs in meta, because it probably serves developer convenience and
        doesn't affect the user (aka non-developer).
        Test-Question: If <something> in meta is lost, does the code still run? 


## Build-System

Using `hatchling`, as seemingly preferred by the *Python Packaging Authority*.
`make build` should normally do the trick, which calls`python -m build` to 
resolve the build-tool-chain dependencies.
